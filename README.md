# European-Soccer-ML
Machine learning project predicting European soccer match outcomes using the European Soccer Database.

## Dataset

The database file `database.sqlite` is too large to include in this repository.  

To run the notebooks locally:

1. Download the European Soccer Database from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer).  
2. Unzip the file and place `database.sqlite` in the `data/` folder.
